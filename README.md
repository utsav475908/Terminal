A collection of codes that I have attempted in Leetcode and yes this is a personal set of my own written codes (Zero copy paste) to 
figure out the transition in a developer from the very naive to experienced to a seasoned one.

1. Aim to write a musical code (I have written the heavy code first...) but gradually with the constant practise of maths , logics and 
puzzle and spiritually(meditation) and following clean code principle ... (aiming for it ...) ,

 these set of codes clearly demonstrate how the transition has happened from the naive developer to an advanced one( i hope so...) 
 
 Thanks
